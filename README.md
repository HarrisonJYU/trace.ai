# trace

Tld;r trace is a tool that helps managers be more productive by providing more information about what their employees are actually doing and working on throughout the week. Trace provides more visibility on reporting and accounting for employees time so managers waste less time collecting, sorting, and finding information about their employees (what they worked on, where they're blocked, who they're interfacing with) and more time doing what they do best.

### Thesis

Ticketing platforms like [Linear](https://linear.app/) and [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) do not provide the full picture on what employees work on. Most companies do not keep their ticketing platforms up to date and most importantly.

-   `cd server`
-   `poetry shell`
-   if it complains about python, do `which python3` to find path of the executable and do `poetry env use <path/to/executable>`
-   `poetry install` to install the dependencies
-   `make sever`
